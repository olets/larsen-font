I would appreciate the lack of fiddling with the authoring information which is part of the font file itself.

This font provides full staff notation for musicians, and is compatible with Finale software. Additionally, for players of Irish Traditional Music (ITM), there are fourteen symbols (developed by Grey Larsen) to notate ornamentation typical of this tradition.

For free details as to the definition and use of most of them, use the PDF file packaged with this file.

For full details and an extensive course of instruction of all of them, buy his book "The Essential Guide to Irish Flute and Tin Whistle", available from the author directly ( http://www.greylarsen.com ) or from Mel Bay Publishing and fine book shops.

Thanks, and happy playing!
