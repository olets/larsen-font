### v1.1

- README updates
- Updates "Book" weight to "Regular"
- Uses a new UniqueID
- _Breaking Change_ Adds "-Regular" to the PostScript font name (use `Larsen-Regular` in place of the older `Larsen`)
- Regenerates the `.ttf` (as `Larsen-Regular.ttf`) and the `.dfont` (as `Larsen-Regular.dfont`)
- Removes the older `Larsen.ttf` (leaves the older `Larsen.dfont`, because `Larsen-Regular.dfont` hasn't been tested on early OSX.)
