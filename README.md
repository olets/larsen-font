_Grey Larsen's introduction ([source](http://greylarsen.com/resources/larsen-font/))_

> David Armstrong of Alberta, Canada, has developed a font called Larsen. This font makes it possible for anyone to utilise the symbols in Grey’s notation system for ornamentation in Irish Traditional Music.
>
> Versions of the font for both Mac and PC are offered here as a free download (zip file).
>
> Included in the zip file is an article by Grey called A Guide to Grey Larsen’s Notation System for Irish Ornamentation. It describes the basic workings of this ornamentation notation system. Feel free to share this article with others. For the fullest exploration of the system, please refer to Grey’s book, The Essential Guide to Irish Flute and Tin Whistle.
>
> David Armstrong developed this font after the publication of Grey’s first two books, The Essential Guide to Irish Flute and Tin Whistle and The Essential Tin Whistle Toolbox. Using the font, as Grey did in his books published in 2013, makes the ornamentation symbols look more crisp and clean than they did in his earlier books. Thank you, David!

(A special thanks goes to Christian for beta-testing and troubleshooting the Mac version!)

I would appreciate the lack of fiddling with the authoring information which is part of the font file itself.

This font provides full staff notation for musicians, and is compatible with Finale software. Additionally, for players of Irish Traditional Music (ITM), there are fourteen symbols (developed by Grey Larsen) to notate ornamentation typical of this tradition.

For free details as to the definition and use of most of them, use the PDF file packaged with this file.

For full details and an extensive course of instruction of all of them, buy his book _The Essential Guide to Irish Flute and Tin Whistle_, available from the author directly (<http://www.greylarsen.com>) or from Mel Bay Publishing and fine book shops.

Thanks, and happy playing!

David Armstrong
