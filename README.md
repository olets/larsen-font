## Tell me more!

_Grey Larsen's introduction ([source on greylarsen.com](http://greylarsen.com/resources/larsen-font/))_

> This font makes it possible for anyone to utilise the symbols in Grey’s notation system for ornamentation in Irish Traditional Music.
>
> Versions of the font for both Mac and PC are offered as a free download.
>
> Included in the package is  an article by Grey called _A Guide to Grey Larsen’s Notation System for Irish Ornamentation_. It describes the basic workings of this ornamentation notation system. Feel free to share this article with others. For the fullest exploration of the system, please refer to Grey’s book, _The Essential Guide to Irish Flute and Tin Whistle_.
>
> David Armstrong developed this font after the publication of Grey’s first two books, _The Essential Guide to Irish Flute and Tin Whistle_ and _The Essential Tin Whistle Toolbox_. Using the font, as Grey did in his books published in 2013, makes the ornamentation symbols look more crisp and clean than they did in his earlier books. Thank you, David!
